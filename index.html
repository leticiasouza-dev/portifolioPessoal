                        creation of well-organized structures, appropriate use of tags and attributes, as well as the ability to develop web pages

                        I have advanced skills in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), allowing me to style and transform HTML elements effectively.
                        My experience includes using selectors, properties, and values ​​to create responsive layouts, enhance visual aesthetics, and
                        ensure a pleasant user experience. I am committed to utilizing best design practices and staying current

                        I have solid knowledge of JavaScript, with skills that range from fundamental concepts to working with
                        arrays. My experience includes effectively manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), applying programming logic

                        Currently, I'm immersed in learning React, a modern JavaScript library for building web interfaces.
                        user interactive and efficient. I'm excited about mastering fundamental concepts like components, state, and
                        props, and I've already started experimenting with creating dynamic and reactive web applications. This is an exciting step in
                        my development journey, and I look forward to applying React's powerful capabilities to future projects.
